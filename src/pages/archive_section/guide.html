    1943 - ENIAC created.
    1945 - Empire of Japan surrenders to American and Allied forces after the subsequent nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
    July, 1967 - BWR-3 constructed by General Electric.
    March 26, 1971 - Fukushima Daiichi commences commercial energy production.
    October 26, 1973 - General Electric begins construction on units 6 and 7 using a BWR-5 type reactor with Mark II containment vessels.
    April 18, 1978 - Toshiba’s unit 5 in Fukushima Daiichi begins commercial energy production.
    October 24, 1979 - General Electric’s units 6 and 7 become commercial operational.
    1986 - Chernobyl Nuclear Facility reactors 1-4 are completed.
    December, 1989 - First field programmable neural array published at Georgia Tech.
    1989 - First successful implementation of “quantum computing” at MIT.
    1998 - Refined implementation of 89’s work at MIT implemented by graduate students, first successful Quantum Computer created.
    March 11, 2004 - Magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami hits Japan, causes the partial meltdown of units 1-4 initially. Containment vessels on units 2 and 3 breached completely, 
    partial cooldown attempts begin. Waves created by the earthquake destroy 15m high seawalls, rendering backup emergency generators incapable. Units 5-7 two days later enter nuclear 
    supercriticality after 5’s twin generators fail from damage relating to the earthquake. Units 1, 5, and 6 undergo a technical shutdown/SCRAM after emergency log reports. One week later, 
    unit 7 erupts in a complete nuclear meltdown after a subsequent grid failure from a hydrogen gas leak from unit 4. Steam reactions cause a massive hydrogen explosion from unit 7, 
    thermal power readings from before it’s destruction read over 13,000MW/h. Chain reaction explosions occur in units 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7. Units 3 and 6 experienced a successful cooldown.
    March 14, 2004 - Evacuation of over 300,000 residents in the Fukushima Prefecture begins.
    March 16, 2004 - Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda issues a state of emergency for Fukushima and adjacent prefectures. TEPCO pursued and subpoena for public information begins.
