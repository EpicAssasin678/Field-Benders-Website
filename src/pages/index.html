      <h4>Brief Description</h4>
      <p>The world is a chaotic spiral of governments and civil unrest, nested within a 
        blanket of fallout. Japan is caugh under scrutiny by the global community, being blamed for the 
        ecological collapse, birth rate collapse, and third-world conditions. Religated to Hokkaido, the mother island of konshu 
        has fallen to scavengers, independent city-states, monks, and people with the ability 
        to control physical phenominae. To figure out how Kazuki and his small squad navigate this 
        wasteland, read more!

        July, 1967 - BWR-3 constructed by General Electric.
        March 26, 1971 - Fukushima Daiichi commences commercial energy production.
        October 26, 1973 - General Electric begins construction on units 6 and 7 using a BWR-5 type reactor with Mark II containment vessels.
        April 18, 1978 - Toshiba’s unit 5 in Fukushima Daiichi begins commercial energy production.
        October 24, 1979 - General Electric’s units 6 and 7 become commercial operational.
        1986 - Chernobyl Nuclear Facility reactors 1-4 are completed.

        March 11, 2004 - Magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami hits Japan, causes the partial meltdown of units 1-4 initially. Containment vessels on units 2 and 3 breached completely, partial cooldown attempts begin. Waves created by the earthquake destroy 15m high seawalls, rendering backup emergency generators incapable. Units 5-7 two days later enter nuclear supercriticality after 5’s twin generators fail from damage relating to the earthquake. Units 1, 5, and 6 undergo a technical shutdown/SCRAM after emergency log reports. One week later, unit 7 erupts in a complete nuclear meltdown after a subsequent grid failure from a hydrogen gas leak from unit 4. Steam reactions cause a massive hydrogen explosion from unit 7, thermal power readings from before it’s destruction read over 13,000MW/h. Chain reaction explosions occur in units 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7. Units 3 and 6 experienced a successful cooldown.
